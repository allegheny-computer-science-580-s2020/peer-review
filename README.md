# cs580s2020-peer-reviews

This repository contains the starter files for peer review assignments in
Computer Science 580 Spring 2020. You are to use this repository for all
peer review tasks in this course.  To learn more about the peer review exercises, please
see assignment 6 found in [Computer Science 580 Website](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/teaching/580/assignments.html).

## Accessing the Peer Review Templates

For all peer review assignments you are to read, review, and provide suggestions
for editing a thesis proposal document  of at least one research partner at its various stages.
After you have made careful and detailed edits in the draft document directly
(either in paper or electronic form), you must also fill out the peer editing summary
using a proper Markdown syntax. You must commit and push the peer editing
summary by midnight of the day the peer editing assignment
is given. Finally, you should add your peer summary as a GitHub issue in the
repository of your research partner.

## Updates

If a course instructor updates the provided material for this assignment and
you would like to receive these updates, then you can type this command in the
main directory for this assignment:

```
git remote add download https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-580-s2020/peer-review.git
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of
your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
course instructor by typing:

```
git pull download master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

This second command can be run whenever a course instructor needs to provide you
with new review template for a peer editing assignment. However, please note that, if you have
edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous
command may lead to Git merge conflicts.
